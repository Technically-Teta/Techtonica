/ Week 3 - Arrays and Objects

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Make an empty array named animals

let animals = []

// Exercise 2. Add the string "frog" to the array

let test = animals.push("frog")
console.log(test)

// Exercise 3. Add 4 more animals of your choice to the array. Try to add all of them in one line of code.

let val1 = animals.unshift('Monkey','Snake','Fish', 'Turtle')
console.log(val1)

// Exercise 4. Update the first item in the array to be "gorilla"

let val2 = animals.shift()
let val3 = animals.unshift('gorilla')
console.log(animals)

// Exercise 5. Print the number of items in the array (use the array property that will give you this information)
console.log(animals.length)


// Exercise 6. Print the first item in the array
const first = animals[0]
console.log(first)


// Exercise 7. Print the last item in the array (as part of your answer, use the same array property you used in exercise 5 above)
const last = animals[animals.length -1]
console.log(last)


// Exercise 8. Remove the last item from the array
const val4 = animals.pop()
console.log(val4)


  
// Exercise 9. Now make a new array named assortedThings that contains at least 3 strings and 3 numbers.

let assortedThings = ['Today', 'Tomorrow' , 'Next', 5,8,29]

// Exercise 10. Write a for loop that iterates through the assortedThings array and prints each index and item, such as:
// Item #0 is potato
// Item #1 is 4
// Item #2 is Hello World
// ...

for (let i = 0; i < assortedThings.length; i++) {
  console.log(`Item #${i} is ${assortedThings[i]}`);
}


// Exercise 11. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter. For each number in the array,
// print the number and "BIG" if it's over 100, "small" if it's between 0 and 100, and "negative" if
// it's less than 0. Example:
// if the array is [-2, 200, 50], print:
// -2 negative
// 200 BIG
// 50 small

function printSize(numbers) {
  for (const number of numbers) {
    const size = number > 100 ? "BIG" : number >= 0 ? "small" : "negative";
    console.log(`${number} ${size}`);
  }
}
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function
const numbers = [-2, 200, 50];
console.log(printSize(numbers))
const numbers1 = [-6, 500, 51];
console.log(printSize(numbers1))



// Exercise 12. Make an object called me that contains the following keys: name, favoriteAnimal, favoriteNumber
// The values of those keys can be whatever you choose.

const me = {
  name : 'Samelia',
  favoriteAnimal : 'Bear',
  favoriteNumber : 28
}


// Exercise 13. Add another 2 keys and values to the object (you choose what they are)

 const favoriteItem = 'favoriteItem'
 const favoriteDay =  'favoriteDay'
 me[favoriteItem] = 'shoes'
 me[favoriteDay] = 'Wednesday'
 console.log(me)

// Exercise 14. Update the favoriteAnimal value to something different

 me.favoriteAnimal = 'Parrot'

// Exercise 15. Print the value of favoriteAnimal.
// Note: there are at least 2 ways to get the value of a key, try to write both.
console.log(me.favoriteAnimal)
const favoriteAnimalValue2 = me['favoriteAnimal'];
console.log(favoriteAnimalValue2)




// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
I had some trouble finding ways to print individual values. Most references suggested for loops to loop thru the entire object but that was 
ineffective .
